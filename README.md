# Personal Project Java Spring Boot
# Back-end Shopping Online (ecommerce website)

a personal project I did while learning about Spring

I build a restful API system of a sales website based on Java Spring Boot framework.

## General
This project is an illustrative example of how to implement important features in a Java Spring Boot application. The application simulates a user management system and product management system of an online shopping website. In which users can register, log in and make changes to personal information, add products to the cart and proceed to purchase.
